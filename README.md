# abak

### Usage:
```sh
$ abak      ; output: current backlight percentage
$ abak 20   ; sets backlight to 20%
$ abak +10  ; adds 10% to backlight
$ abak -10  ; subtracts 10% from backlight
```

### Installation:
(warning: I'm lazy - this makefile just builds the thing and moves it to /bin/)

1. You'll need to manually modify the config.asm
If You don't know how, You can use this sed command and it SHOULD work ðŸ˜Ž:
```sh
sed -i -e "s/intel_backlight/$(ls /sys/class/backlight)/g" ./config.asm
```
2.
```sh
make install
```
